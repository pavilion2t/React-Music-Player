In half month, I have an vital English exam. Vital, because it costs too much.T T  Since I can not spare my working hours reviewing the material, I lower my expectation on the result. Just tell myself: try your best. And I do hope nobody will ask my grade after the exam. Since the truly friends care about whether I am tired rather than the result! :)

Last night, when meditating on the bed, I realized I should change my biological clock. Currently I go to bed at 1 am and get up at half past 8 am. Then I rush to my company and start my work at 9 am. I feel so honored that the company need not check-in, or I will pay for the late penalty to eat soil. :) Suddenly It occurred to me that the stay up obsessive-compulsive disorder habit do harm to my health without any efficiency.

Therefore, I decided to change my biological clock. I plan going to sleep at 11 pm and getting up at 7 am. During the period from 7 am to half past 8 am, I plan to review the English material. This 90 minutes, I suppose, will play a vital role in achieving the final goal. Based on my past experience, making fully use of ninety-minutes is better than a dim evening. And this plan will last for half month.

If fully realized, I will buy a set of FRANIC as reward. XD
